## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: Use Shopify-native quantity price breaks first, a product metafield fallback second, and the legacy HulkApps volume-discount endpoint only when both are absent.
- Phase 1: Keep bulk-tier selection separate from the visible quantity input; validate the selected deal quantity before adding to cart.
- Phase 1: Use Shopify quantity rules plus legacy product JSON inventory as the PDP max quantity cap because this Storefront token cannot read `quantityAvailable`.
- Phase 1: Preserve any pre-existing user edits in product page files.
- Phase 1: Leave the sibling Liquid theme untouched; it remains a reference source only.
- Phase 2: Use the Searchanise Search API JSON response for search results, not the injected Searchanise search-results widget DOM.
- Phase 2: Keep Searchanise PDP recommendations available while preventing Searchanise from taking over `/search` and legacy search-results page routes.
- Phase 2: `/search` is the canonical owned search page; `/pages/search-results` and `/pages/search-results-page` redirect to it with useful query params preserved.
- Phase 2: Next 16 Cache Components needs Suspense around runtime route reads such as the Searchanise loader path check and legacy redirect `searchParams`.

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 2 added: Searchanise API Search Results

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Legacy HulkApps volume tiers are available through the app offer-table endpoint, but that endpoint is an external compatibility dependency rather than a typed Shopify source of truth.
- Legacy product JSON exposes `inventory_quantity` for old-theme parity, but it remains a compatibility fallback until inventory is available through the Storefront token or a first-party API path.
- `src/app/(storefront)/products/[handle]/page.tsx` still has pre-existing unstaged layout edits that were intentionally preserved outside the Phase 1 commit.
- Searchanise's API key is public and already present locally, but API response shape should still be narrowed defensively because Searchanise returns JSON outside the Shopify generated type system.
